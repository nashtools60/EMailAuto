# Email Automation App

## Overview
An intelligent email processing and automation system that monitors incoming emails, classifies them using AI, extracts key information, and generates draft responses for human review.

## Project Architecture
- **Backend**: Python Flask web application
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing configurations, templates, and email drafts
- **Email Integration**: AgentMail for receiving and managing emails
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI (via Replit AI Integrations) for classification, sentiment analysis, and entity extraction
- **Frontend**: HTML/JavaScript interface for configuration and draft review

## Key Features
1. **Multi-Account Support**: Process emails from multiple accounts (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, iCloud, AOL, etc.)
2. **Email Ingestion**: Monitor mailboxes for new emails across all active accounts
3. **Priority-Based Triaging Matrix**: 
   - Three-tier sender whitelists (High Priority, Important, Low Priority)
   - Subject line keyword classification by priority
   - Body content keyword classification by priority
4. **Sender Validation**: Whitelist/blacklist management with categories (Unsubscribe/Permanent Delete)
5. **Content Processing**: Normalize and clean email content
6. **AI Classification**: Categorize emails by topic/intent using Gemini 2.0 Flash
7. **Priority Analysis**: Assign urgency levels and sentiment scores based on triaging rules
8. **Entity Extraction**: Extract structured data from emails
9. **Draft Generation**: Create response drafts using templates
10. **Human Review**: All drafts require human approval before sending
11. **Account Tracking**: Each draft linked to its source email account
12. **Theme Customization**: 8 color schemes including Dark Mode
